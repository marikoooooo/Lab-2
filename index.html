    <h1>What I've been reading</h1>
    <p>I have been reading <i>Tomb of Tut Ankh Amen vol.1</i> by Howard Carter lately. It is a book about the discovery of the "Boy-king" pharaoh Tutankhamun.</p>
    <p>I picked up this book because I was interested in the process of how Tutankhamun's tomb was found since I had watched a couple of YouTube videos on it.</p>
    <p>It is a very interesting book to me because I love ancient history, especially around the time of the Bronze Age.</p>
